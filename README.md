# word-frequency

Task: Calculate word frequency in large text file.
Also, I'm using this task to learn golang.

Implementation objectives:

Phase 1: Get words and counts (case sensitive + case insensitive)

- ~~Basic implementation~~
- ~~Add basic diagnostics to capture execution time~~
- More fine grain control on splitting words
    - Remove punctuation
- Split implementations into multiple files
- Run all implementations via harness that also does multiple iterations to average out timings
- Implement case insensitive version
    
Phase 2: 
     
- Order results from phase 1 to find the most frequent word
- Create custom data structure (max-heap) to improve performance on this aspect
